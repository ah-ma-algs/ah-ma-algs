A normal, very intuitive, method when introducing any unknown subject is to use comparison and contrast to measure a known subject against the unknown one and grow branches betwixt them.

Also, A normal introduction when discussing any RNN's receptive field is discussing a human's visual receptive field first, I believe that discussing the auditory system introduces complementary yet essential concepts to better understand a RNN's receptive field but we will start with the visual receptive field firstly.

We can start with the first comparison, which is the vertebrate eye ( such as humans ) vs cephalopods ( active marine predators )

Vertebrate eyes are formed as outgrowths of the brain while cephalopods's eyes are invaginations of the body surface.

This makes the cornea, a structural part of a human's eyes, and focusing, a result of changing the lens's shape, while the cephalopods focus through movement, mobile phones and cameras generally focus through the movement as well.

Insert videos of movements here.

As with everything in biology, there are naturalists and creationists on opposite sides.
Naturalists stubbornly trying hard to prove that the vertebrate's eye design is an indicative of evolution, mal-adaptation in that case, evolution, the blind, impersonal force ,which stacked one layer of adaptation induced mechanism over another until it was stuck with a basis that has to have its problems fixed instead of starting all over, which it can't do.

For some reason as well, evolution became synonymous with darwinism and darwinian evolution became the sole cause of emergence and evolution, and proponents of such a theory defend it more than darwin even did.

creationists on the other hand, struggle to prove that each and every bit of the eye is 100% where its supposed it to be, serves a purpose and could not have been made any better.

Both ways actually are very devastating to the whole process as they either lead to us only labeling the eye constituing components and treating them as blind tools with limited use only managed by something upper ( just like aristotle once thought a brain was simply a radiator to keep a heart from overheating ) or giving too much significance to some parts and getting lost in the details, missing the bigger picture.

Regardless, Most vertebrate eyes are reverted, meaning, the light sensitive part is facing opposite to the light source, while the cephalopods eyes are placed the same as anyone would work it out, the light sensitive part is placed facing the light source.

Wow, what a beautiful picture.
